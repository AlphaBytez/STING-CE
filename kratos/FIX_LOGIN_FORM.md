# Fix for "Failed to load login form" Error

## The Problem

Based on our investigation, the "Failed to load login form" error is occurring because:

1. The frontend is trying to connect to Kratos using HTTPS (`https://localhost:4433`)
2. Our Kratos instance is actually serving on HTTP (`http://localhost:4433`)
3. There might be CORS issues when the frontend tries to access Kratos API endpoints

## Solution Steps

### 1. Update Environment Variables

Make sure the REACT_APP_KRATOS_PUBLIC_URL environment variable is correctly set in your frontend:

```bash
# Add to frontend/.env.local
REACT_APP_KRATOS_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:4433
```

The important part is to use HTTP rather than HTTPS if you're testing with a development Kratos setup.

### 2. Fix CORS Configuration

Ensure that your Kratos configuration has the correct CORS settings. Here's what it should look like in your kratos.yml:

```yaml
serve:
  public:
    base_url: http://localhost:4433
    cors:
      enabled: true
      allowed_origins:
        - http://localhost:3000
      allowed_methods:
        - GET
        - POST
        - PUT
        - DELETE
        - OPTIONS
      allowed_headers:
        - Authorization
        - Content-Type
        - X-Session-Token
      allow_credentials: true
```

### 3. Fix Network Traffic

If you're using browser development tools, you may need to:

1. Open Chrome DevTools â†’ Network tab
2. Check "Disable cache" 
3. Make sure you're not blocking the Kratos domain

### 4. Check SSL/TLS Configuration

Since your frontend tries to use HTTPS by default, you can either:

1. Configure Kratos to use HTTPS with proper certificates
2. Modify your frontend code to use the correct protocol:

```javascript
// Change this in LoginPage.js
const KRATOS_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_KRATOS_PUBLIC_URL || 'http://localhost:4433';
```

### 5. Test with Direct API Access

Use the provided test-login.html page to verify Kratos is working correctly:

```bash
# Open the test page in your browser
open /Users/captain-wolf/Documents/GitHub/STING-CE/STING/kratos/test-login.html
```

## Verification Steps

After making these changes:

1. Restart your frontend service
2. Check browser console for any CORS or network errors
3. Try to access the login page
4. Monitor the Kratos logs to see if the API calls are reaching the service

## Debugging Commands

```bash
# View Kratos logs
docker logs kratos-kratos-1

# Test Kratos API directly
curl http://localhost:4433/self-service/login/api | jq .

# Verify CORS headers
curl -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" -v http://localhost:4433/self-service/login/api
```

If you continue to have issues, check your browser's Network tab for specific error messages.
