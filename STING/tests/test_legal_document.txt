Dear Mr. Smith,

I am writing to update you on the status of your personal injury case against Johnson Construction Company. As discussed in our privileged communication, the opposing counsel has made a settlement offer of $50,000.

Case Details:
- Accident occurred on January 15, 2024
- Client sustained back injury requiring surgery
- Medical expenses total $25,000 to date
- Lost wages: $15,000

Settlement Analysis:
Based on my review of similar cases and the medical documentation provided by Dr. Sarah Williams (License: MD-789456), I believe we can negotiate for a higher settlement amount. The opposing party's insurance company (Policy Number: INS-789456123) appears motivated to settle quickly.

Legal Strategy:
1. Counter-offer with $75,000 demand
2. Highlight ongoing medical treatment needs
3. Emphasize lost earning capacity
4. Prepare for potential mediation
