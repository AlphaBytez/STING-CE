### Competitive Pricing Analysis

**Research Competitors:**
```
Step 1: Find 3-5 comparable products
Step 2: Note their pricing
Step 3: Assess their content quality vs. yours
Step 4: Price 10-20% higher if superior, 10-20% lower if building brand
```

**Example Competitive Matrix:**

| Competitor | Price | Content Quality | Your Advantage |
|------------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
