## Industry-Specific ROI Calculators

### Legal Firms
**Savings Formula:**
```
Annual Savings = (Associate Hours Saved × Billing Rate) - STING Cost
Example: (1,500 hours × $350/hr) - $50K = $475K annual savings
```

### Healthcare
**Value Formula:**
```
Annual Value = (Diagnostic Improvements × Patient Volume × Revenue per Patient) + Compliance Cost Avoidance
Example: (23% × 10,000 patients × $5,000) + $500K = $11.5M + $500K = $12M value
```

### Financial Services
**Return Formula:**
```
Risk-Adjusted Return = (Portfolio Performance Improvement × AUM) × (1 - Operational Risk Reduction)
Example: (15% × $500M) × 0.95 = $71.25M additional returns
```
