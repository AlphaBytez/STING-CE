# Honeycomb Vault Architecture
## Secure Internal Document Sharing with PII Separation

### Overview
The Honeycomb Vault system enables organizations to share sensitive documents internally while maintaining complete control over PII exposure. Users can upload documents in multiple formats, with PII automatically separated and stored in secure "cells" within the organization's Hive Vault.

## 🍯 Core Concepts

### Terminology
- **Honeycomb Vault**: Organization's master secure storage system
- **Pollen Key**: Encryption key for accessing PII data within documents
- **Royal Jelly**: Complete, unredacted document with full PII
- **Worker Bee Format**: Sanitized/serialized document safe for general access
- **Hive Vault**: Central repository for all organizational PII
- **Nectar Transfer**: Secure protocol for sharing documents internally
- **Bee Dance Protocol**: Key exchange mechanism for PII access
- **Honeycomb Cells**: Individual encrypted storage units for PII elements

## 📤 Upload Workflows

### Workflow 1: Pre-Encrypted Document Upload
```
User has encrypted document from external source
    ↓
Upload encrypted file + Pollen Key
    ↓
System validates key authenticity
    ↓
Document stored in Honeycomb Vault
    ↓
Key stored in separate secure cell
    ↓
Access granted based on user permissions
```

### Workflow 2: Local PII Scrubbing
```
User uploads original document
    ↓
Client-side Bee Agent scrubs PII
    ↓
Creates two outputs:
    1. Worker Bee Format (sanitized)
    2. PII Extraction Map
    ↓
Both uploaded separately
    ↓
System generates Pollen Key
    ↓
Organization members can reconstruct with proper access
```

### Workflow 3: Hybrid Upload
```
User processes document locally
    ↓
Separates into:
    - Public content (Worker Bee Format)
    - Private content (PII cells)
    - Access matrix (who can see what)
    ↓
Uploads with organization-specific encryption
    ↓
System assigns to appropriate Honeycomb cells
    ↓
Granular access control applied
```

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Encryption
```yaml
encryption_layers:
  transport:
    protocol: "TLS 1.3"
    cipher: "AES-256-GCM"
  
  storage:
    document_encryption: "AES-256-CBC"
    pii_encryption: "AES-256-GCM"
    key_derivation: "PBKDF2-SHA512"
  
  key_management:
    master_key: "HSM-protected"
    pollen_keys: "User-specific derivation"
    rotation: "90-day automatic"
```

```yaml
access_levels:
  queen_bee:  # Administrators
    - view_royal_jelly: true
    - access_all_pollen_keys: true
    - modify_permissions: true
    - export_with_pii: true

    - export_sanitized: true
  
  drone_bee:  # External/Temporary
    - view_worker_format: limited
    - no_pii_access: true
    - time_limited: true
    - audit_all_actions: true
```

## 🔄 Nectar Transfer Protocol

### Internal Document Sharing Flow
```python
class NectarTransfer:
    def share_document(self, doc_id, recipient_ids, access_level):
        """
        Share document within organization
        """
        # Step 1: Validate sender permissions
        if not self.can_share(sender, doc_id):
            raise PermissionError("Insufficient privileges")
        
        # Step 2: Generate temporary Pollen Key
        temp_key = self.generate_pollen_key(
            doc_id=doc_id,
            recipients=recipient_ids,
            expiry=calculate_expiry(access_level),
            pii_access=determine_pii_access(access_level)
        )
        
        # Step 3: Create access record
        access_record = {
            "document": doc_id,
            "shared_by": sender.id,
            "shared_with": recipient_ids,
            "pollen_key": encrypt_key(temp_key),
            "access_level": access_level,
            "expires": expiry_timestamp
        }
        
        # Step 4: Notify recipients via Bee Dance
        self.bee_dance_notification(recipient_ids, access_record)
        
        # Step 5: Log in audit trail
        self.audit_log(access_record)
        
        return access_record
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Legal Document Review
**Scenario**: Law firm needs to share contracts internally with varying PII visibility

**Solution**:
1. Senior partner uploads contract with full PII
2. System creates Worker Bee Format (names/amounts redacted)
3. Junior associates see sanitized version
4. Partners access full version with Pollen Key
5. Audit trail tracks all access

### Use Case 2: Healthcare Records Management
**Scenario**: Hospital sharing patient records between departments

**Solution**:
1. Medical records uploaded with PII separated
2. Billing sees financial info only
3. Doctors see medical info only
4. Administration sees statistics only
5. Each department has specific Pollen Keys

### Use Case 3: Financial Audit Preparation
**Scenario**: Preparing documents for internal audit with selective PII

**Solution**:
1. Finance team uploads reports
2. PII automatically extracted to Honeycomb cells
3. Auditors receive Worker Bee Format
4. Specific PII revealed on request with approval
5. Complete audit trail maintained
