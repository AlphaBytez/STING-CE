# üêù Bee-Powered Support System

The Bee-Powered Support System revolutionizes how users get help with STING-CE by combining AI intelligence, automated diagnostics, and secure delivery channels for seamless support experiences.

## Overview

Instead of manually gathering logs and system information, users can simply chat with Bee about their problems and get professional-grade support bundles with secure delivery to the support team.

### Key Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Issue Analysis**: Bee understands STING architecture and correlates issues with services
- üéØ **Intelligent Diagnostics**: Automated honey jar creation with targeted log collection
- üí¨ **Conversational Interface**: Natural language support requests via Bee Chat
- üîí **Secure Delivery**: Tailscale ephemeral tunnels for safe diagnostic transfer
- üîê **Permission Management**: Admin-only access with confirmation workflows
- üìã **Ticket Management**: Full lifecycle support request tracking

## How It Works

### 1. User Reports Issue via Chat

```
User: "@bee I'm having login issues after the update"

Bee: "I understand you're experiencing authentication problems. This appears to be 
related to the Kratos authentication service and app middleware. Let me analyze 
the situation and create a targeted diagnostic bundle.

Should I:
1. Capture Kratos and app service logs from the last hour
2. Include startup logs to check for update-related issues  
3. Focus on authentication flows and session management

What would you prefer?"
```

### 2. AI-Guided Diagnostic Collection

Bee intelligently maps issues to services and suggests relevant diagnostic focuses:

- **Authentication Issues** ‚Üí Kratos + App services, `--auth-focus` flag
- **UI Problems** ‚Üí Frontend + Nginx services, startup logs
- **API Errors** ‚Üí App + Database services, connection logs
- **AI Chat Issues** ‚Üí Chatbot + External AI services, `--llm-focus` flag
- **Performance Problems** ‚Üí All services, `--performance` metrics

### 3. Automated Honey Jar Creation

Bee creates optimized diagnostic bundles based on issue analysis:

```
Bee: "Creating authentication-focused diagnostic bundle:
‚úÖ Capturing Kratos logs (last 60 minutes)
‚úÖ Capturing app service logs (last 60 minutes)  
‚úÖ Including startup logs for update analysis
‚úÖ Running AAL2 flow diagnostics
üîÑ Creating sanitized honey jar...
```

### 4. Secure Support Delivery

For Professional and Enterprise tiers, Bee establishes secure Tailscale tunnels:

```
Bee: "Diagnostic bundle ready (2.3MB, fully sanitized).
Would you like me to establish a secure connection for support team access?
This creates a temporary encrypted tunnel."

User: "Yes, create secure connection"

Bee: "I need admin confirmation for support access. 
Please type 'GRANT_SUPPORT_ACCESS' to authorize."

User: "GRANT_SUPPORT_ACCESS"

Bee: "‚úÖ Support ticket #ST-2025-001 created
‚úÖ Tailscale tunnel established (expires in 24h)
‚úÖ Support team notified
üìß Email confirmation sent"
```

## Architecture Integration

### Bee System Knowledge

Bee maintains comprehensive knowledge of STING architecture:

- **Service Dependencies**: Understands which services work together
- **Log Correlation**: Knows which logs to capture for specific issues
- **Common Patterns**: Recognizes frequent problems and their signatures
- **Troubleshooting Flows**: Guides users through systematic problem solving

### Service Mappings

| Issue Type | Primary Services | Diagnostic Focus | Log Sources |
|------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Authentication | Kratos, App | `--auth-focus` | kratos, app, db |
| Frontend Loading | Frontend, Nginx | Startup logs | frontend, nginx |
| API Errors | App, Database | Connection logs | app, db |
| AI Chat Issues | Chatbot, External-AI | `--llm-focus` | chatbot, external-ai |
| Performance | All Services | `--performance` | All services |

### Permission Framework

#### Access Levels
- **Community**: Chat-based diagnostics + manual honey jar delivery
- **Professional**: + Tailscale ephemeral access + priority support
- **Enterprise**: + Dedicated tunnels + on-call support

#### Security Model
- Admin-only support request creation
- Confirmation required for secure access grants
- Full audit trail of all support actions
- Automatic session cleanup and data retention
