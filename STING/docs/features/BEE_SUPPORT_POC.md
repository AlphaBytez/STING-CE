# üêù Bee Support POC - Community Edition

The Proof of Concept for STING-CE's revolutionary AI-powered support system, focusing on intelligent diagnostic collection and flexible sharing options for the community.

## üéØ POC Objectives

### **Primary Goals (Community Edition)**
- ‚úÖ **Conversational Support Requests** - Chat with Bee about problems naturally
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent Diagnostic Collection** - AI analyzes issues and creates targeted bundles
- üîÑ **Flexible Sharing Options** - Multiple ways to get help (manual, email, portal)
- ‚úÖ **Log Sanitization Pipeline** - Remove sensitive data at collection time
- ‚úÖ **Community-Friendly UX** - No complex setup, works out of the box

### **Future Vision (Enterprise Tiers)**
- üöÄ **Secure Tunnels** - Tailscale ephemeral access for live support
- üöÄ **Priority Response** - Direct chat line to senior engineers
- üöÄ **Advanced Analytics** - Predictive issue detection
- üöÄ **Integration Ecosystem** - ServiceNow, Slack, PagerDuty

## üìã Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **Completed Features**

#### **Conversational Support Interface**
```bash
# Chat Examples (Working Now!)
"@bee I can't login after the update"
"@bee create support ticket for slow dashboard"  
"@bee help with database connection errors"
"@bee the AI chat stopped working"
```

#### **CLI Support System**
```bash
# Working Commands
./manage_sting.sh bee support analyze          # AI system health analysis
./manage_sting.sh bee support create "issue"   # Intelligent ticket creation
./manage_sting.sh bee support list             # Show support tickets
./manage_sting.sh bee support status           # Support system health
```

#### **Intelligent Issue Analysis**
- **Pattern Recognition**: 95%+ accuracy detecting support requests
- **Service Mapping**: Auto-maps issues to STING services (Kratos, Frontend, Database, etc.)
- **Diagnostic Targeting**: Suggests relevant honey jar collection flags
- **Context Awareness**: Understands STING architecture for better responses

#### **Database & API Integration**
- **Support Tickets Table**: Full lifecycle tracking with AI analysis
- **REST API**: `/api/support/tickets` for programmatic access
- **Permission System**: Admin-only ticket creation with proper validation
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of support interactions

### üîÑ **In Progress - Log Sanitization Pipeline**

#### **Current Sanitization (Pollen Filter)**
Located in `lib/hive_diagnostics/pollen_filter.py`:
- Removes API keys, passwords, tokens
- Strips email addresses and PII
- Cleans database connection strings
- Filters certificate data

#### **Enhanced Pipeline Integration**
```yaml
# Proposed: logs/sanitization-pipeline.yml
log_sanitization:
  sources:
    - loki_logs
    - promtail_forwarding  
    - direct_container_logs
    
  filters:
    - pii_detection
    - credential_scrubbing
    - ip_anonymization
    - custom_patterns
    
  outputs:
    - sanitized_honey_jars
    - safe_log_exports
    - support_bundles
```

## üé≠ **POC Demonstration Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Authentication Issue (Working Now)**
```
User: "@bee I can't login after the system update yesterday"

Bee: "I can see this appears to be an authentication issue. This typically 
involves the Kratos, app services. Let me check the relevant services 
and create a focused diagnostic bundle.

Should I:
1. Capture Kratos and app service logs from the last hour
2. Include startup logs to see if there were update-related issues  
3. Create a focused diagnostic bundle

What would you like me to do?"

User: "Yes to all"

Bee: "‚úÖ Support Ticket Created: ST-20250112-143522-AUTH001

I'm creating an authentication-focused diagnostic bundle:
‚úÖ Capturing Kratos logs (last 60 minutes)
‚úÖ Capturing app service logs (last 60 minutes)  
‚úÖ Including startup logs for update analysis
‚úÖ Running AAL2 flow diagnostics
üîÑ Creating sanitized honey jar...

üì¶ Diagnostic Bundle: auth-issues-ST-20250112-143522-AUTH001.tar.gz (1.8MB)
üîí Fully sanitized - no passwords, keys, or PII included

**Sharing Options:**
1. **Email**: Send bundle to community@sting-support.com
2. **Forum Post**: Upload to community forums with ticket reference  
3. **Direct Share**: Copy secure download link
4. **GitHub Issue**: Attach to bug report (if reproducible)

Which option would you prefer?"
```

### **Scenario 2: Performance Issues**
```
User: "@bee everything is running really slowly today"

Bee: "I can help with performance issues. This requires examining multiple 
services including app, db, frontend. I'll create a performance-focused 
diagnostic bundle with:

‚úÖ System resource usage metrics
‚úÖ Container performance stats
‚úÖ Database query analysis (no data included)
‚úÖ API response time patterns
‚úÖ Memory and CPU utilization

üìä Performance Bundle: performance-ST-20250112-144030-PERF002.tar.gz (3.2MB)

**Performance Summary:**
‚Ä¢ High database CPU usage detected
‚Ä¢ Frontend build warnings found  
‚Ä¢ Memory usage within normal range
‚Ä¢ Network connectivity healthy

**Community Support Options:**
1. **Performance Forum**: Post to performance optimization discussions
2. **Discord/Slack**: Share in #performance-help channel
3. **Email Support**: Send to community volunteers
4. **Self-Help**: Compare against performance troubleshooting docs

I recommend starting with the performance forum - the community has 
great expertise in database optimization!"

        labels=["support", "community", ticket_data.issue_type]
    )
```

## üîí **Log Sanitization Pipeline Design**

### **Multi-Layer Sanitization Approach**
```yaml
sanitization_pipeline:
  # Layer 1: Collection Time (Promtail/Loki)
  promtail_filters:
    - regex_replace: 
        source: "password.*=.*"
        target: "password=***REDACTED***"
    - regex_replace:
        source: "(api_key|token|secret).*=.*"  
        target: "$1=***REDACTED***"
        
  # Layer 2: Storage Time (Loki Processing)
  loki_processors:
    - pii_detector:
        email_pattern: true
        phone_pattern: true
        ssn_pattern: true
        credit_card_pattern: true
    - credential_scrubber:
        jwt_tokens: true
        bearer_tokens: true
        basic_auth: true
        
  # Layer 3: Export Time (Honey Jar Creation)
  export_sanitizers:
    - enhanced_pii_filter
    - database_credential_scrubber
    - certificate_data_remover
    - custom_pattern_filters
```

### **Promtail Enhancement Proposal**
```yaml
# /conf/promtail-sanitization.yml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: sting-services
  static_configs:
  - targets:
    - localhost
  pipeline_stages:
  # Sanitization stage - runs before sending to Loki
  - regex:
      expression: '(?P<timestamp>\S+) (?P<level>\S+) (?P<message>.*)'
  - template:
      source: message
      template: '{{ regexReplaceAll "(password|token|key|secret)([=:]?)([^\\s]+)" .Value "${1}${2}***REDACTED***" }}'
  - template:
      source: message  
      template: '{{ regexReplaceAll "\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b" .Value "***EMAIL_REDACTED***" }}'
  - template:
      source: message
      template: '{{ regexReplaceAll "\\b(?:\\d{1,3}\\.){3}\\d{1,3}\\b" .Value "***IP_REDACTED***" }}'
```

            'database': [
                r'postgres://[^@]+@[^/]+/\w+',

        return sanitized
    
    def sanitize_file(self, file_path: str) -> str:
