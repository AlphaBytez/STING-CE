# Bee Dances Enterprise Features

## Overview

Bee Dances is STING's advanced notification and communication hub that extends beyond simple alerts to provide intelligent, context-aware messaging with enterprise-grade features for collaboration, security, and compliance.

## Core Concept

Just as bees perform "waggle dances" to communicate the location of valuable resources to their hive, Bee Dances allows STING users to share critical insights, notifications, and discoveries across their organization in a secure, intelligent manner.

## Enterprise Features

### 1. Report Completion Notifications

**Intelligent Report Processing Alerts**

When STING completes processing a honey jar or generates a report, Bee Dances automatically:

- **Notifies relevant stakeholders** when their reports are ready
- **Provides summary insights** directly in the notification
- **Includes security classification** (Sensitive, Confidential, Public)
- **Offers quick actions** (View, Download, Share, Archive)
- **Tracks acknowledgment** for compliance purposes

#### Implementation Details

```javascript
// Report completion webhook integration
{
  type: 'report_complete',
  priority: 'high',
  title: 'üìä Financial Analysis Q4 2024 Complete',
  content: 'Your quarterly financial analysis is ready. 47 anomalies detected, 3 require immediate attention.',
  metadata: {
    report_id: 'rpt_2024_q4_fin_001',
    processing_time: '4m 23s',
    document_count: 1247,
    classification: 'confidential',
    anomalies: {
      critical: 3,
      warning: 12,
      info: 32
    }
  },
  actions: [
    { type: 'view_report', label: 'View Report', require_auth: true },
    { type: 'download_pdf', label: 'Download PDF' },
    { type: 'share_secure', label: 'Secure Share' },
    { type: 'schedule_review', label: 'Schedule Review' }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Notification Forwarding with PII Scrubbing

**Secure External Communication**

Enterprise users can configure automatic forwarding of notifications to external systems while ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.

#### Features

- **Multi-channel forwarding**: Email, Slack, Teams, Webhook, SMS
- **Intelligent PII detection and removal**
- **Configurable scrubbing rules per channel**
- **Audit trail for all forwarded notifications**
- **Encryption in transit and at rest**

#### PII Scrubbing Engine

The PII scrubbing engine automatically detects and removes sensitive information before forwarding:

**Detected PII Types:**
- Social Security Numbers (SSN)
- Credit card numbers
- Bank account numbers
- Email addresses (configurable)
- Phone numbers (configurable)
- Physical addresses
- Medical record numbers
- Driver's license numbers
- Passport numbers
- Custom patterns (regex-based)

**Scrubbing Strategies:**

1. **Redaction**: Replace with `[REDACTED]`
2. **Masking**: Show partial data (e.g., `***-**-1234` for SSN)
3. **Tokenization**: Replace with secure reference token
4. **Hashing**: One-way hash for correlation without exposure
5. **Removal**: Complete removal from message

#### Configuration Example

```yaml
notification_forwarding:
  enabled: true
  channels:
    - type: email
      endpoint: compliance@company.com
      pii_scrubbing:
        level: strict
        strategy: redaction
        patterns:
          - ssn
          - credit_card
          - bank_account
        custom_patterns:
          - pattern: 'EMP\d{6}'
            label: 'Employee ID'
            action: mask_last_3
    
    - type: slack
      webhook_url: ${SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}
      pii_scrubbing:
        level: moderate
        strategy: masking
        exclude_patterns:
          - email  # Emails allowed in Slack
      
    - type: siem
      endpoint: https://siem.company.com/api/events
      auth_type: bearer
      pii_scrubbing:
        level: minimal  # SIEM needs more context
        strategy: tokenization
        token_vault: internal_vault
```

class NotificationForwarder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pii_scrubber = PIIScrubber()
        self.audit_logger = AuditLogger()
        self.encryption = EncryptionService()
    
    async def forward_notification(self, notification, channel_config):
        # Audit original
        await self.audit_logger.log_original(notification)
        
        # Scrub PII based on channel config
        scrubbed = await self.pii_scrubber.scrub(

        }
        self.nlp_detector = NLPBasedPIIDetector()  # ML-based detection
    
    async def scrub(self, text, rules):
        scrubbed_text = text
        detected_pii = []
        
        # Pattern-based detection
        for pii_type, pattern in self.patterns.items():
            if pii_type in rules.patterns:
                matches = re.finditer(pattern, scrubbed_text)
                for match in matches:
                    scrubbed_text = self._apply_strategy(
                        scrubbed_text, 
                        match,

                        'type': pii_type,
                        'position': match.span(),
                        'strategy': rules.strategy
                    })
        
        # NLP-based detection for context-aware PII
        nlp_results = await self.nlp_detector.detect(scrubbed_text)
        for detection in nlp_results:
            scrubbed_text = self._apply_nlp_scrubbing(
                scrubbed_text,
                detection,
                rules
            )
            detected_pii.append(detection)
        
        return {
            'scrubbed_text': scrubbed_text,
            'detected_pii': detected_pii,
            'rules_applied': rules
        }
```

## Security Considerations
