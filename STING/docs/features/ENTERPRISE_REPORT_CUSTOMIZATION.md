- **Technology**: ReportLab Python library

### Customization Points

1. **Color Definitions** (line ~248):

   STING_BLUE = colors.HexColor('#1e40af')
   STING_DARK = colors.HexColor('#1f2937')
   ```

2. **Header Branding** (line ~254):
   ```python
   story.append(Paragraph("Generated by <b>STING Platform</b>", header_style))
   ```

3. **Table Styling** (line ~353):
   ```python
   ('BACKGROUND', (0, 0), (-1, 0), STING_BLUE),
   ('TEXTCOLOR', (0, 0), (-1, 0), colors.white),
   ```

4. **Footer Branding** (line ~410):
   ```python
   f"üêù <b>STING Platform</b> ‚Ä¢ Generated on {generation_time}"
   ```

## Benefits for Presentations

The current professional styling provides:

- **Executive-Ready Appearance**: Clean, corporate design suitable for C-level presentations
- **Brand Consistency**: STING blue theme throughout all elements
- **Professional Typography**: Proper hierarchy and readability
- **Data Clarity**: Clear table formatting with alternating rows
- **Trust Indicators**: Platform attribution and generation timestamps

This styling will make demos and presentations significantly more impactful by showing enterprise-grade report quality rather than basic text outputs.
