## üöÄ **How It Works**

### **The Magic Flow:**
```
Customer Problem ‚Üí Bee Analysis ‚Üí Support Ticket ‚Üí Secure Tunnel ‚Üí Community Help
     (Chat)           (AI)         (Auto)           (Headscale)      (Volunteers)
```

### **Detailed Workflow:**
```
1. Customer: "@bee I need help with authentication issues"

2. Bee: "I've analyzed this as an authentication issue and created 
   diagnostic bundle ST-2025-001. Would you like me to create a 
   secure tunnel for community volunteer assistance?"

3. Customer: "GRANT_COMMUNITY_ACCESS"

4. System: 
   ‚úÖ Creates Headscale user: support-st-2025-001
   ‚úÖ Generates ephemeral auth key (expires in 30 min)
   ‚úÖ Posts to community #urgent-help channel
   ‚úÖ Provides volunteers secure access credentials

5. Community Volunteer:
   ‚úÖ Installs Tailscale client
   ‚úÖ Joins support network: tailscale up --login-server=http://customer.domain:8070 --authkey=...
   ‚úÖ Securely accesses customer STING system
   ‚úÖ Reviews diagnostic bundle and provides assistance
   
6. Auto-Cleanup:
   ‚úÖ Tunnel expires after 30 minutes
   ‚úÖ Volunteer access automatically revoked
   ‚úÖ Complete audit report generated
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Implementation Details**

### **Headscale Service (Port 8070)**
```yaml
# Added to docker-compose.yml
headscale:
  container_name: sting-ce-headscale
  image: headscale/headscale:0.23.0
  ports:
    - "8070:8070"  # Web interface (avoiding 8080 conflict)
    - "9090:9090"  # Metrics endpoint
  volumes:
    - ./conf/headscale:/etc/headscale:ro
    - headscale_data:/var/lib/headscale
  environment:
    - HEADSCALE_EPHEMERAL_NODE_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT=30m
    - HEADSCALE_BASE_DOMAIN=support.sting.local
  profiles:
    - support-tunnels
    - full
```

### **Configuration Integration**
```yaml
# Added to config.yml
headscale:
  enabled: true
  server:
    port: 8070  # Avoiding 8080 conflict
    base_domain: "support.sting.local"
  support_sessions:
    default_duration: "30m"  # Community support
    max_duration: "4h"       # Enterprise support
    max_concurrent: 5
  security:
    ephemeral_node_timeout: "30m"
    enable_routing: false  # Don't route customer networks
```

### **New CLI Commands**
```bash
# Support tunnel management
./manage_sting.sh support tunnel create ST-2025-001     # 30min tunnel
./manage_sting.sh support tunnel create ST-2025-002 4h  # 4hr tunnel  
./manage_sting.sh support tunnel list                   # List active
./manage_sting.sh support tunnel status ST-2025-001     # Check status
./manage_sting.sh support tunnel close ST-2025-001      # Close tunnel
./manage_sting.sh support tunnel headscale-status       # Service health
```

## üîí **Security Model**

### **Access Control (policy.hujson)**
```json
{
  "groups": {
    "group:community-helpers": [],  // Community volunteers
    "group:sting-support": []       // Official support team
  },
  "acls": [
    {
      "comment": "Community helpers can access customer STING systems",
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["group:community-helpers"],
      "dst": [
        "tag:customer-device:22",    // SSH for troubleshooting
        "tag:customer-device:8888"   // Bee Chat for guided support
      ]
    },
    {
      "comment": "Deny access to customer internal networks", 
      "action": "deny",
      "src": ["group:community-helpers"],
      "dst": ["!tag:customer-device"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Ephemeral Sessions**
- **30-minute default** for community support
- **Auto-expiration** - no manual cleanup needed
- **No persistent access** - users deleted after session
- **Scoped permissions** - SSH to STING containers only

## üíº **Community Support Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Authentication Help**
```
Customer: "@bee I can't login after the Kratos update"

Bee: "I've identified this as an authentication issue affecting 
Kratos and app services. I've created diagnostic bundle 
ST-2025-123 with auth-focused logs.

The community #auth-help channel has volunteers who specialize 
in Kratos troubleshooting. Would you like me to create a secure 
tunnel so they can help you directly?"

Customer: "Yes, create secure access"

Bee: "üîê Community Volunteer Access Setup:
I need authorization for temporary system access.

This will:
‚Ä¢ Create 30-minute encrypted tunnel
‚Ä¢ Allow community volunteer secure SSH access
‚Ä¢ Provide access to diagnostic bundle
‚Ä¢ Auto-expire after session
‚Ä¢ Full audit trail

‚ö†Ô∏è This grants temporary system access to community volunteer
Type 'GRANT_COMMUNITY_ACCESS' to authorize."

Customer: "GRANT_COMMUNITY_ACCESS"

Bee: "‚úÖ Community Support Tunnel Active
üîó Tunnel: support-st-2025-123.support.sting.local
üë• Posted to #auth-help channel with access details
‚è∞ Auto-expires in 30 minutes

Community volunteer can now:
‚Ä¢ Securely SSH to your STING containers
‚Ä¢ Review diagnostic bundle with auth logs  
‚Ä¢ Test authentication flows safely
‚Ä¢ Provide real-time troubleshooting assistance

I'll notify you when someone connects to help!"
```

### **Scenario 2: Performance Investigation**
```
Customer: "@bee Dashboard is extremely slow, need community help"

Bee: "Performance issue detected. I've created a comprehensive 
diagnostic bundle with resource metrics and service logs.

Our community performance experts can help investigate:
‚Ä¢ Database query optimization
‚Ä¢ Container resource tuning
‚Ä¢ Frontend build optimization
‚Ä¢ Network connectivity issues

Should I create a secure tunnel for expert community assistance?"

[Community volunteer connects via Headscale tunnel]

Volunteer: "I can see from your diagnostic bundle that the database
is missing an index. Let me check your actual query patterns..."

[Direct SSH access to containers for live debugging]

Volunteer: "Found it! Your user_sessions table needs an index on 
expires_at. I can apply the fix now if you'd like."

Customer: "Yes please!"

[Issue resolved in 10 minutes with direct access]
```
