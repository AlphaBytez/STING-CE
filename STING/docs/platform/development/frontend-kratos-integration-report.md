# Frontend Kratos Integration Analysis

This report analyzes the current state of Ory Kratos integration in the frontend codebase and provides recommendations for components that need to be added or modified to fully integrate with Kratos authentication.

## Current Integration Status

The codebase already has significant Kratos integration work completed, including:

- A comprehensive `KratosProvider` context for authentication state management
- Protected route components for securing application routes
- Login and registration flows with Kratos redirects
- Email verification flow
- Error handling for authentication issues
- Account settings integration with Kratos

## Components by Authentication Flow

### 1. Authentication Routes and Redirects

**Implemented:**
- `/frontend/src/auth/AuthenticationWrapper.jsx` - Main wrapper that sets up routes and the Kratos provider
- `/frontend/src/auth/ProtectedRoute.jsx` - Protects routes requiring authentication
- `/frontend/src/auth/LoginRedirect.jsx` - Handles redirects to Kratos login
- `/frontend/src/auth/RegistrationRedirect.jsx` - Handles redirects to Kratos registration

**Missing or Needs Updates:**
- Proper handling of redirect URLs after successful authentication
- Account recovery flow redirects
- Two-factor authentication redirects (if planned)

### 2. Session Management

**Implemented:**
- `/frontend/src/auth/KratosProvider.jsx` - Checks `/sessions/whoami` to determine authentication status
- Handling of session-related state (loading, authenticated)

**Missing or Needs Updates:**
- Session refresh mechanism for long-lived sessions
- Session timeout handling
- Better error handling for session API failures

### 3. User Profile and Settings

**Implemented:**
- `/frontend/src/auth/AccountSettings.jsx` - Basic settings integration that redirects to Kratos settings flow

**Missing or Needs Updates:**
- Complete integration with Kratos settings flows:
  - Profile update flow
  - Email change flow
  - Password change flow
  - MFA configuration flow (if needed)
- Custom settings flow UI rather than redirecting to Kratos directly
- Account deletion flow integration

### 4. Registration Flows

**Implemented:**
- `/frontend/src/components/auth/SimpleRegistrationPage.jsx` - Simple registration page that redirects to Kratos
- `/frontend/src/components/auth/KratosRegistration.jsx` - More comprehensive registration with WebAuthn support

**Missing or Needs Updates:**
- Consistent registration flow (currently has both simple and full versions)
- Better error handling with field-specific error messages
- Registration form for Kratos traits beyond just email/password
- Clearer indication of verification requirements after registration

### 5. Login Flows

**Implemented:**
- `/frontend/src/components/auth/LoginKratosCustom.jsx` - Custom login form with fallback

**Missing or Needs Updates:**
- Support for all Kratos login methods (password, WebAuthn, social login)
- Better integration with Kratos login UI nodes
- Remember me functionality
- Support for admin login or other role-based logins

### 6. Verification Flows

**Implemented:**
- `/frontend/src/components/auth/VerificationPage.jsx` - Email verification flow

**Missing or Needs Updates:**
- Better handling of verification error states
- Resend verification email functionality
- User feedback during verification process

### 7. Setting Flows

**Implemented:**
- Basic settings flow in AccountSettings.jsx

**Missing or Needs Updates:**
- Complete Kratos settings flow integration
- Custom UI for updating user profile information
- Custom UI for security settings (password change, MFA)
- Custom UI for account linking (if needed)

### 8. Password Reset Flows

**Missing:**
- Password reset/recovery initiation page
- Password reset completion page
- Error handling for password reset flows

### 9. Logout Handling

**Implemented:**
- Basic logout functionality in KratosProvider.jsx

**Missing or Needs Updates:**
- Confirmation dialog before logout
- Proper cleanup of application state on logout
- Handling of forced logouts (expired sessions)

## Key Components to Add or Modify

1. **Password Recovery Flow (`/frontend/src/auth/PasswordRecovery.jsx`)**
   - Create this component to handle the password recovery flow
   - Implement initiation of recovery (request code/link)
   - Implement completion of recovery (setting new password)

2. **Settings Flow UI (`/frontend/src/auth/SettingsFlow.jsx`)**
   - Create a custom UI for the Kratos settings flow
   - Handle profile information updates
   - Handle security settings (password change, MFA)
   - Integrate with account deletion flow

3. **Two-Factor Authentication Setup (`/frontend/src/auth/TwoFactorSetup.jsx`)**
   - If MFA is planned, create a component for setting up TOTP or other 2FA methods
   - Include QR code display, verification code entry, and recovery codes

4. **Social Login Integration**
   - Update login components to support OAuth providers if configured in Kratos

5. **Session Management Enhancement (`/frontend/src/auth/SessionManager.jsx`)**
   - Create a component/hook to handle session refresh, timeout, and expiry

6. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Enhance error page to better explain different authentication errors
   - Implement field-level error displays for forms

## Recommended Implementation Plan

1. **Short Term (High Priority)**
   - Implement password recovery flow
   - Complete the settings flow integration
   - Add consistent error handling

2. **Medium Term**
   - Implement two-factor authentication (if needed)
   - Add social login support (if needed)
   - Create a more robust session management system

3. **Long Term**
   - Implement advanced security features (security logs, account activity)
   - Add multi-tenant support if needed
   - Implement comprehensive role-based access controls

## Conclusion

The frontend codebase has a good foundation for Kratos integration, but several key components need to be added or modified for a complete authentication experience. The most critical missing pieces are the password recovery flow and a complete settings flow UI for managing user profiles and security settings.

The existing architecture with KratosProvider as the central authentication state manager is sound and provides a good foundation to build upon. The recommendations in this report will help complete the integration with Kratos and provide a seamless authentication experience for users.
