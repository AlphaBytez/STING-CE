# Bee Agentic Capabilities Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the planned agentic capabilities for Bee, STING-CE's AI assistant, which will enable automated system management, troubleshooting, and process execution based on user authorization and configurable rules.

## Agentic Bee Architecture

### Core Concept
Bee will function as an intelligent agent capable of:
- Analyzing system health and diagnostics
- Executing authorized administrative tasks
- Following user-defined rules and permissions
- Providing proactive system maintenance
- Automating troubleshooting workflows

### Authorization Framework

#### Permission Levels
1. **Read-Only** - System monitoring and reporting only
2. **Basic Actions** - Simple fixes (restart services, clear caches)
3. **Advanced Actions** - Configuration changes, model management
4. **Administrative** - Full system control, user management
5. **Emergency** - Critical system recovery operations

#### Rule-Based Authorization
```yaml
# Example authorization rules
user_permissions:
  admin_users:
    - full_system_control
    - emergency_operations
    - user_management
  
  power_users:
    - service_management
    - model_operations
    - configuration_changes
  
  standard_users:
    - basic_troubleshooting
    - personal_settings
    - read_only_diagnostics

action_rules:
  restart_service:
    required_permission: "service_management"
    confirmation_required: false
    audit_log: true
  
  modify_configuration:
    required_permission: "configuration_changes"
    confirmation_required: true
    backup_required: true
    audit_log: true
```

## Honey Jar Integration Strategy

### Automated Troubleshooting
Bee will integrate with the honey jar system to:
- Execute diagnostic scripts from `troubleshooting/` directory
- Analyze health check results
- Automatically apply appropriate fixes
- Escalate complex issues to human administrators

### Script Integration Points

#### Health Monitoring Scripts
- `check_llm_health.sh` - LLM service health assessment
- `check_admin.py` - Administrative interface validation
- `diagnose_docker_issues.sh` - Container health diagnostics

#### Automated Fix Scripts
- `fix-all-services.sh` - Comprehensive service restart
- `fix-auth-and-dashboard.sh` - Authentication system fixes
- `fix_env_issues.sh` - Environment configuration repairs
- `clean_model_downloads.sh` - Model cache management

#### Model Management
- `download_optimized_models.sh` - Automated model downloads
- `setup-model-symlinks.sh` - Model path configuration
- `sting-model-manager.sh` - Model lifecycle management

### Workflow Examples

#### Scenario 1: Service Health Check
```
1. User: "Bee, check if all services are running properly"
2. Bee executes: lib/hive_diagnostics/honey_collector.sh
3. Bee analyzes results and identifies failed LLM service
4. Bee asks: "LLM service is down. Should I restart it?" (if user has service_management permission)
5. User confirms, Bee executes: troubleshooting/restart-chatbot.sh
6. Bee reports: "LLM service restarted successfully"
```

#### Scenario 2: Model Download Issue
```
1. System alert: Model download failed
2. Bee automatically runs: troubleshooting/test_model_download.sh
3. Bee identifies network/token issue
4. Bee executes: troubleshooting/check_hf_token.sh
5. If token invalid, Bee notifies admin for manual intervention
6. If token valid, Bee retries download with troubleshooting/ensure_proper_models.sh
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Basic Bee chatbot functionality
- [x] Honey jar diagnostic framework (`lib/hive_diagnostics/`)
- [x] Troubleshooting script collection
- [ ] Authorization framework design

### Phase 2: Basic Agentic Capabilities
- [ ] Permission system implementation
- [ ] Rule-based action authorization
- [ ] Basic script execution capabilities
- [ ] Audit logging system

### Phase 3: Advanced Automation
- [ ] Proactive health monitoring
- [ ] Automated troubleshooting workflows
- [ ] Configuration management
- [ ] Model lifecycle automation

### Phase 4: Intelligent Operations
- [ ] Predictive maintenance
- [ ] Performance optimization suggestions
- [ ] Resource usage optimization
- [ ] Advanced security monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Command Execution Safety
- All script executions must be pre-approved and sandboxed
- Input validation and sanitization required
- Command injection prevention
- Resource usage limits and timeouts

### Audit and Compliance
- Complete audit trail of all agentic actions
- User consent tracking for automated operations
- Rollback capabilities for configuration changes
- Emergency stop mechanisms

### Permission Escalation Prevention
- Strict role-based access control
- No privilege escalation without explicit authorization
- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Session-based permission validation

## Configuration Management

### Easy Rule Setup
```yaml
# bee_agent_config.yml
agent_settings:
  auto_health_check_interval: "5m"
  max_concurrent_actions: 3
  require_confirmation_for:
    - service_restarts
    - configuration_changes
    - model_downloads
  
  emergency_contacts:
    - admin@company.com
    - ops-team@company.com

automation_rules:
  disk_space_low:
    threshold: "85%"
    action: "clean_logs"
    permission_required: "basic_actions"
  
  service_down:
    detection: "health_check_failure"
    action: "restart_service"
