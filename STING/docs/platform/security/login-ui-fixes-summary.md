# Login UI Fixes Summary - July 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ "Or continue with password" Showing Before Email Entry
**Problem**: The separator text appeared on the initial login screen
**Fix**: Added conditions to only show separator when:
- `identifierSubmitted === true`
- `showPasswordField === true` 
- `getWebAuthnButton()` returns truthy (multiple auth methods)

### 2. ✅ Passkey Button on Initial Screen
**Problem**: "Sign in with Passkey" and "Or sign in with email" showed before any interaction
**Fix**: Removed the custom passkey button completely from the initial screen (line 1060)
**Result**: Clean initial screen with only "Sign In with Email" button

### 3. ✅ No Email Field Until Refresh
**Problem**: Initial page load showed simplified UI without input fields
**Fix**: Added flow initialization tracking:
- Added `flowInitialized` state variable
- Show "Initializing login..." while flow is being created
- Only show UI after flow initialization completes or fails
**Result**: Page always shows proper form with email input

## Current Login Flow

### Initial Load
1. Shows "Initializing login..." spinner
2. Automatically creates a Kratos login flow
3. Updates URL with flow ID
4. Shows full login form

### After Flow Initialization
```
STING Logo
Sign in to STING
[Admin Notice if applicable]
Email: [_______________]
[Continue] button
"Forgot your password?"
"Don't have an account? Register"
```

### After Email Submission
1. Submits identifier with method='password'
2. Receives 400 status with updated flow (expected)
3. Shows password field
4. If WebAuthn available, shows both options with separator

## Technical Changes

### State Management
```javascript
// Added flow initialization tracking
const [flowInitialized, setFlowInitialized] = useState(false);

// Set when flow is created or errors
setFlowInitialized(true);
```

### Render Logic
```javascript
// Show loading while initializing
if (!flowInitialized && isLoading) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />;
}

// Show simple UI only after initialization
if (!flowData && flowInitialized) {
  return <SimpleLoginUI />;
}

// Otherwise show full form
return <FullLoginForm />;
```

## Remaining Issues

### Authentication Failure
- Login with admin@sting.local / Password1! returns "invalid credentials"
- This appears to be a backend/credential issue, not frontend
- Frontend correctly submits form-encoded data to Kratos

### Code Cleanup Needed
- Remove unused `handleCustomPasskeyLogin` function
- Remove unused `handleWebAuthnLogin` function
- Remove `hasCustomPasskeys` state variable
- Fix `eval()` usage for security

## Testing Checklist

✅ Initial page shows loading spinner
✅ Flow automatically initializes
✅ Email field appears without refresh
✅ No passkey button on initial screen
✅ No "Or continue with password" before email entry
✅ Identifier-first flow works correctly
✅ 400 status handled as expected
❌ Authentication with provided credentials (backend issue)
