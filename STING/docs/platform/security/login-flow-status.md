# Login Flow Status - July 2025

## Summary

The authentication cleanup to use Kratos as the single source of truth has been completed. The UI fixes have been applied and the frontend no longer shows "Or continue with password" before email entry.

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ **Fixed UI Issue**: Removed the confusing "Or continue with password" text that appeared before email submission
2. ✅ **Updated Frontend Logic**: The separator now only shows when:
   - `identifierSubmitted` is true
   - `showPasswordField` is true  
   - There are WebAuthn options available (multiple auth methods)
3. ✅ **Frontend Service Updated**: Applied the changes successfully

## Current Status

### Working:
- ✅ UI correctly shows email input first without confusing text
- ✅ Frontend properly handles the 400 status code from Kratos (contains valid flow data)
- ✅ Identifier-first flow transitions correctly from email to password entry
- ✅ Admin user exists in Kratos (ID: f8ca1372-f437-499f-89c4-1a17af4494b7)

### Issue:
- ❌ Login with admin@sting.local / Password1! returns "invalid credentials" error
- ❌ Password file is missing from expected locations

### API Test Results:
```
- Kratos identifier-first flow works correctly
- Returns 400 status with updated flow data (expected behavior)
- Password field becomes available after identifier submission
- Authentication fails with "invalid credentials" error
```

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Admin Password**: The admin user exists but authentication fails. Need to:
   - Check if the password needs to be reset
   - Verify there are no middleware issues blocking login
   - Check if force_password_change is interfering

2. **Test with Different User**: Create a new test user to verify if the issue is specific to the admin account

3. **Check Backend Logs**: Review Kratos and app logs to understand why authentication is failing

## Architecture Confirmation

The system now follows the intended architecture:
```
User → Frontend (React) → Kratos (All Auth) → App Backend (Session Validation Only)
```

- Kratos handles all authentication (passwords, WebAuthn, sessions)
- Frontend uses Kratos flows via AJAX (no browser redirects)
- Backend only validates Kratos sessions
