# Kratos Login Flow - Final Summary

## Current Status

The authentication system has been successfully cleaned up to use Kratos as the single source of truth. The identifier-first login flow is working correctly via API testing.

## Key Findings

### 1. Login Flow Working Correctly
- Kratos identifier-first flow is functioning properly
- API returns 400 status but includes the updated flow data (this is expected behavior)
- Password field appears after identifier submission
- The flow transitions correctly from `choose_method` to password entry

### 2. Frontend Issues
The frontend login page has some issues with the form submission:
- The action URL points to nginx proxy instead of Kratos directly
- Form submission needs to use `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format
- AJAX submission should handle the 400 status code properly (it contains valid flow data)

### 3. Configuration
- Kratos is correctly configured with identifier-first style
- WebAuthn is enabled and registration works
- Session management is working correctly

## Recommended Fixes

### Frontend Form Submission
1. The 400 status code with valid flow data should be treated as success
2. Update the response handling to check for flow data in the response
3. The URL rewriting to point directly to Kratos is correct

### Updated Code Pattern
```javascript
// In handleIdentifierSubmit
if (response.status === 400 && response.data?.ui) {
    // This is actually success - Kratos returns 400 with updated flow
    setFlowData(response.data);
    setIdentifierSubmitted(true);
    setShowPasswordField(true);
}
```

## Architecture Summary

```
User → React Frontend → Kratos (All Auth) → Backend (Session Validation)
```

- **Kratos**: Handles all authentication (passwords, WebAuthn, sessions)
- **Frontend**: Uses Kratos flows via API/AJAX (not browser redirects)
- **Backend**: Only validates Kratos sessions via middleware

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Removed custom WebAuthn implementation
- ✅ Cleaned up Flask session creation
- ✅ Fixed Kratos WebAuthn registration (403 error)
- ✅ Archived unused login components
- ✅ Fixed UnifiedAuthProvider to use only Kratos
- ✅ Verified login flow works via API

## Remaining Work
- Update frontend to handle 400 status with flow data
- Test passkey login after identifier submission
- Consider implementing custom passkey UI (user request)
