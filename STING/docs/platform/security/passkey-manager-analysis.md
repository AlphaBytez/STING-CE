# PasskeyManager.jsx Analysis and Fix

## Problem Summary

The original PasskeyManager.jsx was receiving a 400 error "Could not find a strategy to update your settings" when attempting to register passkeys. After deep analysis comparing with Kratos 1.3.1 documentation, several fundamental issues were identified.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Incorrect Form Submission Strategy**
The original code was trying to manually submit form data with specific fields:
```javascript
formData.append('webauthn_register_trigger', 'true');
formData.append('webauthn_register_displayname', passkeyName);
```

However, Kratos WebAuthn registration doesn't work this way. It expects:
1. A proper settings flow to be created
2. The correct trigger node to be submitted (which is a submit button, not just a field)
3. The browser to handle the WebAuthn ceremony via JavaScript

### 2. **Missing WebAuthn Script Execution**
Kratos returns a script node that must be executed in the browser to trigger the WebAuthn ceremony. The original code was looking for this script but not properly executing it.

### 3. **Incorrect Node Identification**
The code was looking for nodes with specific names but not checking their types. In Kratos, the WebAuthn trigger is a submit button (`type: "input"`, `attributes.type: "submit"`), not just a regular input field.

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Fixed Programmatic Registration (PasskeyManagerFixed.jsx)

This approach:
1. Properly identifies the WebAuthn submit trigger node
2. Submits the form with the correct trigger
3. Handles the script execution for WebAuthn ceremony
4. Monitors for completion

Key improvements:
```javascript
// Find the actual submit button trigger
const triggerNode = flow.ui.nodes.find(
  n => n.group === 'webauthn' && 
  n.attributes?.name === 'webauthn_register_trigger' &&
  n.type === 'input' &&
  n.attributes?.type === 'submit'
);

// Submit with the trigger value
formData.append(triggerNode.attributes.name, triggerNode.attributes.value || '');
```

### Approach 2: Embedded Iframe (PasskeyManagerEmbedded.jsx)

This approach:
1. Creates a settings flow
2. Embeds the Kratos UI in an iframe
3. Lets Kratos handle all the WebAuthn complexity
4. Monitors for completion and refreshes

Benefits:
- Guaranteed compatibility with Kratos updates
- No need to understand Kratos internals
- Simpler implementation

## WebAuthn Flow in Kratos 1.3.1

Based on the documentation and testing:

1. **Settings Flow Creation**: GET `/.ory/self-service/settings/browser`
2. **Form Submission**: POST to flow action URL with:
   - CSRF token
   - Display name (optional)
   - Trigger button value
3. **Script Response**: Kratos returns a flow with a script node
4. **Browser Ceremony**: The script triggers the browser's WebAuthn API
5. **Completion**: Session is updated with new credential

## Key Learnings

1. **Don't fight the framework**: Kratos has specific expectations for how WebAuthn should work
2. **Script execution is critical**: The WebAuthn ceremony must be triggered by Kratos's JavaScript
3. **Node types matter**: Submit buttons are different from regular inputs
4. **Consider using iframes**: For complex Kratos flows, embedding the UI can be simpler

## Recommendations

1. **For production**: Use the embedded iframe approach (PasskeyManagerEmbedded.jsx) for maximum compatibility
2. **For custom UI**: Use the fixed programmatic approach (PasskeyManagerFixed.jsx) but be prepared to update it with Kratos changes
3. **Test thoroughly**: WebAuthn is complex and browser-dependent
4. **Monitor Kratos updates**: The WebAuthn implementation may change between versions

## Testing Instructions

1. Clear browser cookies and cache
2. Login to STING
3. Navigate to Security Settings
4. Click "Register New Passkey"
5. Enter a name for the passkey
6. Complete the browser prompt
7. Verify the passkey appears in the list

## Known Limitations

1. **Domain binding**: Passkeys are bound to the domain they're created on
2. **Browser support**: Not all browsers support WebAuthn
3. **Cross-origin issues**: The programmatic approach may have issues with strict CSP policies
