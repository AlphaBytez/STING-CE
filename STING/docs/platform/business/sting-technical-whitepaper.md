# STING Technical Whitepaper

## Executive Summary

STING (Secure Trusted Intelligence and Networking Guardian) is a hybrid AI and security-focused platform designed to handle sensitive, personal, and enterprise data securely while offering powerful automation and natural language-driven capabilities. This whitepaper outlines the system’s architecture, purpose, technical components, and future direction.

---

## Problem Statement

Enterprise users increasingly face challenges in managing sensitive data while leveraging powerful AI tools. Centralized LLM APIs may expose users to data leaks, compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), and lack of control over processing pipelines. Traditional chatbot tools are often black-box systems and don't allow for auditability or internal integration.

---

## STING’s Mission

STING exists to provide a **secure**, **private**, and **compliant** environment for AI-powered collaboration. It empowers businesses and individuals to leverage advanced language models while retaining full control over their data flow.

---

## Core Features

- 🔐 **Zero-trust security principles** for each service
- 🧠 **Modular AI agents** that communicate securely with context enforcement
- 🪪 **PII scrubbing and tokenized data replacement**
- 🛡️ **Audit logging**, with internal-only data retention policies
- 💬 **Interactive chatbot frontend** powered by locally or externally-hosted LLMs
- 🧩 **Plugin-like architecture** for data ingestion, transformation, and reporting
- 🗃️ **Vault-secured credential storage** using HashiCorp Vault
- 🔗 **Open LLM compatibility** with gateways for local or cloud access

---

## Architecture Overview

The architecture consists of containerized microservices orchestrated via Docker Compose (and later Nomad). Major components include:

- **Frontend:** React-based UI (Next.js in mobile-first roadmap)
- **Backend API:** Flask and Node.js (multi-language)
- **Authentication:** Ory Kratos (replacing SuperTokens)
- **Knowledge Base:** ChromaDB with embedding-based document chunking
- **Chat Agent:** Supports Bee AI Agent, using local (e.g., Phi-3) or remote models (OpenAI, Ollama)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16, with tuning for constrained edge devices
- **Secrets Management:** HashiCorp Vault
- **Messaging Queue:** Redis for in-app secure messaging & events
- **Report Engine:** Worker queue pattern with async background job runners

---

## Compliance & Privacy

STING prioritizes in-node data sanitation to avoid sending PII to LLMs. The system supports:

- Configurable **PII detection and redaction pipelines**
- Secure audit logs (can be disabled)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) and policy enforcement
- **Pluggable GDPR/CCPA export + deletion modules** (WIP in Alpha)
- End-to-end encryption in transit (TLS), and optional at-rest encryption

> ⚠️ Compliance certifications (e.g., SOC 2, HIPAA) are not yet complete but are on the roadmap for production tiers.

---

## Performance & Deployment

Designed to run on modest hardware (e.g., 4-core CPUs, 8 GB RAM), the system supports:

- Horizontal scaling of services like agents and workers
- ARM & x86 multi-arch support (e.g., Raspberry Pi, AWS Graviton)
- Optional GPU acceleration (via Ollama or local model runners)
- Simple 1-line setup with `.env` and `config.yml` driven logic

---

## Observability: HiveMind (WIP)

STING includes a modular observability system nicknamed **HiveMind**:

- Collects logs from services via Fluent Bit (lightweight log collector)
- Stores logs centrally in Loki or Elasticsearch (configurable)
- Grafana dashboards pre-wired for:
  - Agent activity
  - System health
  - LLM token usage
  - User sessions & API calls
- Log forwarding to external SIEMs via GELF/HTTP

> Users may opt to disable logging or exclude sensitive services.

---

## AI Model Compatibility

Supports hybrid deployment strategies:

- ✅ Local: Phi-3, Zephyr, Mistral, LLaMA via Ollama or LM Studio
- ☁️ Remote: OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere (via gateway service)
- 🔌 Model chaining & agent memory under test in Alpha

> NOTE: External models may leak data; local is recommended for private use.

---

## Roadmap

- ✅ MVP launched for internal alpha testing (Q3 2025)
- 🛠️ Plugin marketplace for agents, scrapers, exporters (Q4 2025)
- 📊 Data policy analytics & consent management (Q4 2025)
- 🔐 End-user vault with personal tokenized storage (2026)
- 🌍 Federation mode for cross-node collaboration (2026)
- 📜 Compliance automation with audit trail replay (2026+)

---

## Target Users

- 📁 SMBs handling sensitive customer data (healthcare, legal, finance)
- 🔐 Security-conscious development teams
- 🧪 Researchers & R&D with IP-sensitive material
- 🤝 Teams looking to empower non-technical users with safe AI

---

## Conclusion

STING is more than just a chatbot or assistant—it’s a secure gateway for safe, auditable, and intelligent workflows powered by customizable language models. In a world demanding transparency and security, STING aims to be the hive where secure AI thrives.
