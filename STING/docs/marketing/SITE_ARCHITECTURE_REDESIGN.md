**Revolutionary Conversational Support:**

<div class="chat-demo">
User: "@bee I can't login after the update"
Bee: "I can see this is an authentication issue affecting Kratos and app services. Let me create an auth-focused diagnostic bundle... ✅ Bundle created with secure 48-hour download link!"
</div>

**Result: Professional diagnostics in 30 seconds, expert help in 4 hours**

## 📊 **Lead Generation Strategy**

### **Progressive Profiling Approach:**
```
Visit 1: Email only (low friction)
Visit 2: Company + use case (progressive profiling)  
Visit 3: Technical requirements (sales qualification)
Visit 4: Budget + timeline (sales-ready lead)
```

### **Lead Scoring Integration:**
```javascript
// Lead scoring based on engagement
const leadScore = {
  visitedSupport: +20,      // High intent
  watchedDemo: +30,         // Very high intent  
  downloadedCE: +15,        // Technical evaluator
  enterpriseContact: +50,   // Sales-ready
  returnVisitor: +10,       // Growing interest
  timeOnSite: +1/minute     // Engagement level
}
```
