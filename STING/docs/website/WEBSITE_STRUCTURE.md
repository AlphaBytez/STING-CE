**How It Works**:
```
Your Files → Encrypted → Processed → Stored in YOUR Cloud
     ↓           ↓           ↓              ↓
  You Own    You Control  We Never See  You Access

## 💬 Key Messaging Framework

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"STING is the only document processing platform that never sees your data. We're like a postal service that processes mail without opening it. Your files stay in your storage, we just provide the secure processing layer. Zero-knowledge, zero lock-in, zero compromise."

### Problem Statement
"Every organization needs to process sensitive documents with AI, but sending them to OpenAI or Google breaks compliance. Keeping everything on-premises is expensive and complex. There's been no middle ground—until now."

### Solution Statement
"STING provides secure document processing without ever touching your data. Upload to your own storage, process through our zero-knowledge proxy, maintain complete compliance. We handle the complexity, you keep the control."

### Differentiation
"Unlike [Competitor X] who stores your data, or [Competitor Y] who requires on-premises deployment, STING offers true hybrid processing. Your data, your storage, our security layer. It's that simple."
