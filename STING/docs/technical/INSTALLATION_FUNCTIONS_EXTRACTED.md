   - Sources main .env file if present

7. **build_llm_images** (referenced in build_and_start_services)
   - Builds LLM base images
   - Handles platform-specific builds (macOS stub vs full Linux)

8. **wait_for_vault** (line 2637 in manage_sting.sh)
   - Waits for Vault service initialization
   - Includes timeout and retry logic

9. **start_llm_services** (referenced in build_and_start_services)

   - Handles different model configurations (small, performance, minimal)

10. **show_status** (referenced in build_and_start_services)

## Integration Notes

- The `lib/installation.sh` module now sources `lib/file_operations.sh` to access the `copy_files_to_install_dir` and `symlink_env_to_main_components` functions
- The main `install_msting` function has been simplified to use `initialize_sting` instead of calling individual functions
- All dependencies are properly sourced at the top of the module
- The refactored code maintains backward compatibility with existing installation workflows
