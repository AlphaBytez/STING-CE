## Research Completed 📋

### Existing Report Infrastructure:
1. **DashboardPage.jsx** (Line 108): Has "View Reports" button that needs to be connected
2. **BeeChat.jsx** (Line 38): Has analytics tool with description "Generate reports"
3. **AnalyticsPage.jsx** (Line 33): Shows "Reports" as a usage category with 12% usage

### Key Findings:
- BeeChat already has report generation capability via analytics tool
- Need to create dedicated reports page at `/dashboard/reports`
- Reports should integrate with existing chat functionality

## Implementation Completed ✅

### 1. BeeReportsPage Component ✅
**Location**: `/frontend/src/components/pages/BeeReportsPage.jsx`

**Implemented Features**:
- **Report Queue Section**: Shows pending/processing reports with real-time progress
- **User Reports Section**: Displays user's generated reports with status tracking
- **Available Reports Section**: Shows pre-configured reports with permissions
- **Report Actions**: Export, Share, View buttons for completed reports
- **Search and Filter**: Search by name and filter by status/type
- **Mock Data**: Complete test data structure for all report types

### 2. Route Configuration ✅
**Updated `MainInterfaceV2.js`**:
- Added route: `{ path: '/dashboard/reports', name: 'Bee Reports', icon: <FileTextOutlined /> }`
- Added Route element: `<Route path="reports" element={<BeeReportsPage />} />`
- Updated navigation display logic for "Reports" abbreviation

### 3. Dashboard Button Connection ✅
**Updated `DashboardPage.jsx`**:
- Added `goToReports` function
- Connected "View Reports" button to navigate to `/dashboard/reports`

### 4. Report Data Structure ✅
**Implemented Complete Schema**:
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  status: 'queued' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed',
  type: 'security' | 'analytics' | 'compliance' | 'performance',
  requestedBy: string,
  requestedAt: Date,
  completedAt: Date,
  format: 'pdf' | 'csv' | 'json',
  size: string,
  downloads: number,
  permissions: {
    canView: string[],
    canExport: string[],
    canShare: string[]
  }
}
```

### 5. UI Components Implemented ✅
1. **ReportCard** - Individual report display with status indicators
2. **ReportQueue** - Real-time queue with progress bars
3. **AvailableReports** - Grid of pre-configured report templates
4. **ReportActions** - View, Download, Share functionality
5. **Search/Filter** - Advanced filtering by status and type

## Next Implementation Steps 🔄

### 1. Backend Integration Points
- API endpoint for report queue: `/api/reports/queue`
- API endpoint for user reports: `/api/reports/user`  
- API endpoint for available reports: `/api/reports/available`
- WebSocket for real-time queue updates

### 2. BeeChat Integration
- Add report generation request handler in BeeChat
- Create report request format for chat messages  
- Handle report generation status updates

## Technical Design Notes 💡

### Report Data Structure:
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  status: 'queued' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed',
  type: string,
  requestedBy: string,
  requestedAt: Date,
  completedAt: Date,
  data: object,
  format: 'pdf' | 'csv' | 'json',
  permissions: {
    canView: string[],
    canExport: string[],
    canShare: string[]
  }
}
```

### UI Components Needed:
1. ReportCard - Display individual report
2. ReportQueue - Show queue status
3. ReportViewer - In-browser report viewing
4. ReportExporter - Handle export functionality
5. ReportSharing - Share reports with teams/users

## Current Status ✅
- **Frontend Implementation Complete**: Full Bee Reports page with all planned features
- **Navigation Integrated**: Reports accessible from floating nav and dashboard button
- **Mock Data Ready**: Complete test data for development and testing
- **Ant Design Theme Applied**: Consistent with STING V2 floating design

## Completed Resume Tasks 📝
1. ✅ Created `BeeReportsPage.jsx` with complete planned structure
2. ✅ Added route to `MainInterfaceV2.js` navigation and routing
3. ✅ Updated Dashboard "View Reports" button with navigation
