## üí¨ Talk Track Scripts

### 30-Second Elevator Pitch
"STING is like having a translator who speaks your language but is blindfolded. They process your words without seeing your documents. Your sensitive files stay in your storage, we provide the secure processing layer. Zero-knowledge, zero lock-in, zero compromise."

### 2-Minute Demo Script
"Let me show you something revolutionary. 
[Upload document]
See how that file went directly to YOUR AWS bucket, not ours?
[Process document]
Now watch‚Äîwe're extracting insights without ever storing your data.
[Show results]
The sanitized results are instant, but the original? Still in YOUR storage, never touched our servers.
[Show audit log]
And here's every action, logged and auditable. 
This is what zero-knowledge processing looks like."

### 5-Minute Discovery Questions
1. "How do you currently handle sensitive document processing?"
2. "What compliance frameworks do you need to maintain?"
3. "Have you ever had to choose between innovation and compliance?"
4. "What would it mean if you could use AI without data exposure?"
5. "How much do you spend on storage and egress fees?"

## üé™ Pricing Conversation Guide

### Value-Based Pricing Discussion

**Don't Lead With Price, Lead With Value:**
"Before we discuss investment, let's calculate your current costs:
- Storage fees: $______/year
- Egress charges: $______/year  
- Compliance audits: $______/year
- Breach insurance: $______/year
- Total: $______/year

STING typically saves 60-80% of these costs while adding capabilities you don't have today."

### Pricing Objection Responses

**"It's too expensive"**
"Let's compare to the cost of a single breach or compliance violation. Our average customer saves 3x our fee in reduced insurance premiums alone."

**"We need to see ROI first"**
"Perfect. Start with STING Lite‚Äîit's free forever. Prove the value, then scale up."

**"Can you match [Competitor]'s price?"**
"We could, but then we'd have to store your data like they do. The zero-knowledge architecture is why you're talking to us."

## üöÄ Closing Techniques

### The Compliance Close
"You mentioned HIPAA compliance is critical. Every day without STING is another day of risk. Should we start with a pilot next week?"

### The Risk Reduction Close
"You're one breach away from headlines. STING makes that impossible‚Äîwe can't leak what we never see. Should we eliminate that risk today?"
