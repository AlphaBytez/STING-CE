# Passkey Authentication Solution

## Problem
Passkey authentication was failing with "Failed to complete authentication" because the session data stored during the `begin` authentication phase wasn't available during the `complete` authentication phase.

## Root Cause
The Flask session (using Redis) wasn't persisting the authentication challenge between requests. This could be due to:
1. Session cookie domain mismatches
2. Redis session serialization issues
3. Cookie not being sent with subsequent requests

## Solution Implemented
Instead of relying on Flask sessions, I implemented database-based challenge storage for WebAuthn authentication, similar to how registration challenges are handled.

### Changes Made:

1. **Added PasskeyAuthenticationChallenge model** (`app/models/passkey_models.py`):
   - Stores authentication challenges in the database
   - Includes expiration and usage tracking
   - Provides methods for creating and validating challenges

2. **Updated WebAuthn authentication routes** (`app/routes/webauthn_routes.py`):
   - `begin_authentication`: Now stores challenges in database instead of session
   - `complete_authentication`: Retrieves challenges from database
   - Added proper challenge cleanup after successful authentication

3. **Database Migration**:
   - Created new table `passkey_authentication_challenges`
   - Added indexes for efficient lookup

### Benefits:
- **More reliable**: Database storage is more persistent than Redis sessions
- **Stateless**: Doesn't rely on session cookies being properly maintained
- **Auditable**: Can track authentication attempts in the database
- **Scalable**: Works across multiple app instances

## Testing the Fix
1. Clear browser cookies
2. Login to the application
3. Navigate to Settings > Security
4. Add a passkey if you haven't already
5. Logout
6. Try to login with passkey - it should work now!

## Debug Commands
```bash
# Check authentication challenges in database
docker exec sting-ce-app python -c "
from app import create_app
from app.models.passkey_models import PasskeyAuthenticationChallenge
app = create_app()
with app.app_context():
    challenges = PasskeyAuthenticationChallenge.query.all()
    print(f'Total challenges: {len(challenges)}')
    for c in challenges:
        print(f'  - Challenge {c.id}: {c.challenge[:20]}... (used: {c.used}, expires: {c.expires_at})')
"

# Monitor authentication attempts
docker logs sting-ce-app --tail 100 2>&1 | grep -i "authentication"
```

## Future Improvements
1. Pass challenge ID through the authentication flow (in frontend state)
2. Add rate limiting for authentication attempts
3. Implement challenge cleanup job to remove expired challenges
4. Add metrics for authentication success/failure rates
