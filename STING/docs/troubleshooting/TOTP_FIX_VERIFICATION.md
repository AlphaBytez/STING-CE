# TOTP Fix Verification Guide

## üîß What Was Fixed

**Issue**: The TOTP enrollment was showing "TEMP_SECRET_FOR_DEMO" instead of generating real TOTP secrets, making QR codes unusable.

**Root Cause**: During refactoring, two TOTP endpoints were created:
- `/api/totp/generate` - **BROKEN** (hardcoded placeholder)  
- `/api/totp/totp-setup` - **WORKING** (real secret generation)

Frontend was calling the broken endpoint.

**Fix Applied**:
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/auth/IntegratedTOTPSetup.jsx`
- **Line 131**: Changed `/api/totp/generate` ‚Üí `/api/totp/totp-setup`

## ‚úÖ How to Verify the Fix

### Method 1: Manual Browser Test

1. **Navigate to enrollment**: https://localhost:8443/enrollment
2. **Login with admin**: `admin@sting.local`
3. **Enter email code** (check http://localhost:8025 for codes)
4. **Look for TOTP setup step**
5. **Check the manual entry code**: Should be a 32-character base32 string like `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP` instead of `TEMP_SECRET_FOR_DEMO`

### Method 2: Automated Test

```bash
node scripts/test-totp-fix.js
```

The script will:
- Login automatically
- Navigate to enrollment  
- Take screenshots of the TOTP setup
- Verify the secret is real

### Method 3: Direct API Test (with session)

```bash
# After logging in through browser, use browser dev tools to copy session cookie
curl -k -X POST https://localhost:5050/api/totp/totp-setup \
  -H "Cookie: ory_kratos_session=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

## üéØ Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
- **Secret**: Real 32-character base32 string (e.g., `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`)
- **QR Code**: Actually scannable by authenticator apps
- **Manual Entry**: Shows the real secret, not placeholder
- **Verification**: TOTP codes from authenticator apps work

### ‚ùå Failure Indicators:
- **Secret**: Still shows `TEMP_SECRET_FOR_DEMO`
- **QR Code**: Cannot be scanned by authenticator apps
- **API Error**: 500 errors when generating TOTP

## üîç Debugging Steps

If the fix doesn't work:

1. **Check Build Status**:
   ```bash
   ./manage_sting.sh status
   ```

2. **Check Frontend Logs**:
   ```bash
   docker logs sting-ce-frontend
   ```

3. **Check Backend Logs**:
   ```bash
   docker logs sting-ce-app | grep -i totp
   ```

4. **Verify Endpoint**: Make sure the endpoint returns real secrets:
   ```bash
   # Should show pyotp.random_base32() call
   grep -A 10 "def setup_totp_json" app/routes/totp_routes.py
   ```

## üìã Files Changed

- ‚úÖ `frontend/src/components/auth/IntegratedTOTPSetup.jsx` (Line 131)

## üß™ Test Scenarios

1. **Fresh Admin Enrollment**: New admin user completes full TOTP ‚Üí Passkey flow
2. **Existing Admin Re-enrollment**: Admin with existing TOTP sees passkey-only setup  
3. **Regular User**: Non-admin users see appropriate enrollment flow
4. **Authenticator App Test**: QR code actually works in Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.

## üîó Related Issues

This fix resolves the enrollment loop where users with existing passkeys were redirected back to enrollment because the TOTP detection was failing due to the broken endpoint.
