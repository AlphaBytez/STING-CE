# üîí Critical Security Fixes Applied

## Problems Found
Your passkey authentication was being completely bypassed due to multiple security holes:

### 1. ‚ùå AAL2 Enforcement Disabled
- **Location**: `app/__init__.py` line 370
- **Issue**: `if False:` was disabling all AAL2 checks
- **Impact**: No second-factor authentication was being enforced

### 2. ‚ùå WebAuthn Endpoints Bypassed All Auth
- **Location**: `app/__init__.py` lines 290-299
- **Issue**: WebAuthn endpoints were in the `skip_auth_paths` list
- **Impact**: Anyone could access passkey endpoints without being logged in

### 3. ‚ùå Settings Page Complete Bypass
- **Location**: `frontend/src/auth/UnifiedProtectedRoute.jsx` lines 71-79
- **Issue**: Settings pages had "ABSOLUTE BYPASS" of all security checks
- **Impact**: No authentication required on settings pages

## Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ Fix 1: Re-enabled AAL2 Enforcement
```python
# BEFORE:
if False:  # Disable AAL2 enforcement temporarily

# AFTER:
if any(request.path.startswith(path) for path in protected_paths):
```
Now AAL2 is properly enforced for admin users on protected routes.

### ‚úÖ Fix 2: Removed WebAuthn from Bypass List
```python
# REMOVED these from skip_auth_paths:
'/api/webauthn/'
'/api/webauthn-enrollment/'
'/api/biometric/'
'/api/settings/'
'/api/user/profile'
'/api/webauthn/native/'
'/api/webauthn/register/'
```
WebAuthn endpoints now require AAL1 (basic auth) first - you must be logged in to register passkeys!

### ‚úÖ Fix 3: Fixed Settings Page Security
```javascript
// BEFORE: Complete bypass for all settings pages
if (location.pathname.includes('/settings')) {
    setBypassActive(true); // NO AUTH REQUIRED!
}

// AFTER: Requires AAL1, only bypasses AAL2 check
if (location.pathname.includes('/settings')) {
    if (!isAuthenticated) {
        return; // Must be logged in!
    }
    // Only bypass AAL2 since they're setting it up
}
```

## Security Model Now

### Authentication Levels:
- **AAL1**: Email + Code (Basic authentication)
- **AAL2**: Passkey/TOTP (Multi-factor authentication)

### Access Control:
1. **Public pages**: No auth required
2. **Basic pages**: AAL1 required (must be logged in)
3. **Protected pages**: AAL1 + AAL2 for admins
4. **Settings page**: AAL1 required, AAL2 bypass (so you can configure it)
5. **WebAuthn registration**: AAL1 required (must be logged in first)

## Testing the Fix

After services restart, test that:
1. ‚úÖ Cannot access settings without logging in first
2. ‚úÖ Cannot register passkeys without being authenticated
3. ‚úÖ Admin users are required to use passkey for protected routes
4. ‚úÖ AAL2 is properly enforced after initial setup
