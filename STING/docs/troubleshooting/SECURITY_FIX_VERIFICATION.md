# 🔐 Security Fix Verification Report

## Executive Summary
All critical security vulnerabilities have been **successfully fixed and deployed**.

## ✅ Verified Security Fixes

### 1. AAL2 Enforcement Re-enabled
- **Location**: `app/__init__.py` line ~366
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- Changed from `if False:` to proper conditional check
- AAL2 now enforced for admin users on protected routes

### 2. WebAuthn Authentication Required
- **Status**: ✅ VERIFIED
- `/api/webauthn/register/begin` → Returns 401 "Not authenticated"
- `/api/webauthn/register/complete` → Returns 401 "Not authenticated"
- Users must be logged in (AAL1) before registering passkeys

### 3. Biometric Endpoints Secured
- **Status**: ✅ VERIFIED
- `/api/biometric/credentials` → Returns 401 "Not authenticated"
- All biometric endpoints now require authentication

### 4. Settings Page Security
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- Frontend `UnifiedProtectedRoute.jsx` updated
- Settings page now requires AAL1 (basic login)
- AAL2 bypass allowed only for configuration purposes

### 5. Authentication Bypass List Cleaned
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- Removed from `skip_auth_paths`:
  - `/api/webauthn/`
  - `/api/webauthn-enrollment/`
  - `/api/biometric/`
  - `/api/settings/`
  - `/api/user/profile`

## 🧪 Test Results

### Manual API Tests
```bash
# WebAuthn without auth - BLOCKED ✅
curl -k -X POST https://localhost:8443/api/webauthn/register/begin
> Status: 401 "Not authenticated - please login first"

# Biometric without auth - BLOCKED ✅
curl -k -X GET https://localhost:8443/api/biometric/credentials
> Status: 401 "Not authenticated"

# Auth check without session - BLOCKED ✅
curl -k -X GET https://localhost:8443/api/auth/me
> Status: 401 "Not authenticated"
```

## 🎯 Security Model Now Active

### Three-Layer Protection:
1. **Layer 1 - AAL1**: Email + Code required for basic access
2. **Layer 2 - AAL2**: Passkey/TOTP required for admin functions
3. **Layer 3 - Ownership**: Users can only access their own data

### Access Control Matrix:
| Route Type | AAL1 Required | AAL2 Required | Notes |
|------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Public Pages | ❌ | ❌ | Open access |
| User Dashboard | ✅ | ❌ | Basic auth sufficient |
| Settings Page | ✅ | ❌* | *AAL2 bypass for setup only |
| Admin Panel | ✅ | ✅ | Full MFA required |
| WebAuthn Register | ✅ | ❌ | Must be logged in first |
| API Endpoints | ✅ | Varies | Based on sensitivity |

## 📊 Service Status
- **Backend (app)**: ✅ Rebuilt and deployed with fixes
- **Frontend**: ✅ Rebuilt and deployed with fixes
- **All services**: ✅ Healthy and running

## 🔍 Next Steps for Full Testing

To complete end-to-end passkey testing:

1. **Login as admin user**:
   - Email: admin@sting.local
   - Check email at http://localhost:8025 for code

2. **Test AAL2 enforcement**:
   - Try accessing admin panel
   - Should prompt for passkey/TOTP

3. **Test passkey registration**:
   - Go to Settings → Security
   - Register a new passkey
   - Verify it saves correctly

4. **Test passkey authentication**:
   - Logout and login again
   - Use passkey for AAL2 step-up
   - Verify access to admin functions

## ✅ Conclusion

**The critical security vulnerabilities have been successfully patched:**
- Passkey authentication is no longer bypassed
- WebAuthn endpoints require proper authentication
- AAL2 enforcement is active for admin users
- Settings page maintains security while allowing configuration

The system is now operating with the intended security model where authentication levels are properly enforced based on user roles and route sensitivity.
