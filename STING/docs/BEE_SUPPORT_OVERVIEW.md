# 🐝 Bee-Powered Support System - Complete Overview

The revolutionary AI-powered support system that transforms how users get help with STING-CE, from community-friendly POC to enterprise-grade secure access.

## 🎯 **What We've Built**

### **The Vision Realized:**
Instead of wrestling with logs and technical diagnostics, users simply **chat with Bee about their problems** and receive professional-grade support bundles with intelligent analysis and secure delivery options.

### **Three Tiers, One System:**
```
Community Edition (POC) → Professional → Enterprise
     ↓                       ↓            ↓
Chat + AI Analysis      + Tailscale    + Senior Engineers
Manual/Email Share      + 4hr SLA      + 15min Response
Forums/Discord          + Auto Access  + Dedicated Tunnels
```

## ✅ **Currently Working (Ready for Testing!)**

### **🗣️ Conversational Support Interface**
```
User: "@bee I can't login after the update"

Bee: "I can see this appears to be an authentication issue. This typically 
involves the Kratos, app services. Let me analyze the situation and create 
a targeted diagnostic bundle.

Should I:
1. Capture Kratos and app service logs from the last hour
2. Include startup logs to check for update-related issues
3. Focus on authentication flows and session management

What would you prefer?"

User: "Yes to all"

Bee: "✅ Support Ticket Created: ST-20250112-143522-AUTH001

Creating authentication-focused diagnostic bundle:
✅ Capturing Kratos logs (last 60 minutes, sanitized)
✅ Capturing app service logs (last 60 minutes, sanitized)  
✅ Including startup logs for update analysis
