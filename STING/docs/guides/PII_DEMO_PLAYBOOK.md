## 🛠️ Demo Troubleshooting

### Common Demo Issues

**Issue**: Container build takes too long
**Solution**: Pre-build images before demo
```bash
cd docker/test-data-generator
docker build -t sting-test-data-generator .
```

**Issue**: Demo data generation fails
**Solution**: Use quick mode for time-constrained demos
```bash
./scripts/generate_test_data.sh --patients 50 --legal-docs 25 --financial-records 50
```

**Issue**: Network connectivity problems
**Solution**: Run offline demo with pre-generated data
```bash
# Pre-generate data and test results
./scripts/demo_complete_pipeline.sh --quick
# Show results from test_data_output/test_results/
```

### Backup Demo Plans

**Plan A**: Full containerized demo (preferred)
**Plan B**: Pre-recorded demo video + live Q&A  
**Plan C**: Static results presentation with detailed metrics

## 🎤 Q&A Preparation

### Technical Questions
**Q**: "How does this compare to existing DLP solutions?"
**A**: "Traditional DLP focuses on preventing data loss. STING focuses on data discovery and classification first - you can't protect what you can't see. We identify 25+ PII types with 95%+ accuracy, then integrate with your existing DLP for enforcement."

**Q**: "What about false positives?"
**A**: "Our context-aware detection reduces false positives to under 3%. For example, we distinguish between a credit card number in a financial document vs. a similar number in an inventory list."

**Q**: "How do you handle custom PII types?"
**A**: "The admin interface allows easy addition of custom patterns. Many customers add employee IDs, internal case numbers, or industry-specific identifiers."

### Business Questions
**Q**: "What's the ROI on this kind of system?"
**A**: "Customers typically see 60% reduction in compliance audit costs, 90% faster data discovery for regulatory requests, and elimination of manual PII review. For a mid-size healthcare org, that's $200K+ annual savings."

**Q**: "How long is implementation?"
**A**: "STING deploys in hours, not months. The containerized architecture means no complex integration - it works with your existing document storage and workflows."

### Compliance Questions
**Q**: "Does this guarantee compliance?"
**A**: "STING provides the automated controls and audit trails that compliance frameworks require. It's a critical component of your compliance program, working alongside your policies and procedures."

**Q**: "How do you stay current with changing regulations?"
**A**: "Our compliance framework mapping is updated regularly. When new PII types or regulations emerge, we can push updates through the admin interface without code changes."
