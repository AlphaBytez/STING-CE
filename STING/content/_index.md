## What is STING?

**A Trusted AI Layer for Your Business Data**  
STING combines the power of intelligent AI agents with a secure-by-default architecture to process sensitive information with confidence.

- ✅ Redact PII before sending to LLMs  
- ✅ Control what’s analyzed, how it’s shared  
- ✅ Audit logs, encryption, and full transparency  
- ✅ Deploy locally or to the cloud

## How It Works

1. Connect your data source (files, APIs, databases)  
2. Assign Bee agents to review, redact, summarize, or classify  
3. Preview findings and generate actionable reports  
4. Securely route results back to your workflows
