# Dashboard Testing Instructions

## Current Status

We're troubleshooting an issue where the dashboard appearance significantly changed after migrating to Kratos authentication. The dashboard should maintain its original design while still working with Kratos.

## Test Approach

We've set up a TestDashboard component with a very distinctive appearance (red-to-green gradient background) to verify that component loading is working properly. This helps isolate whether the issue is with:

1. Component loading/routing (if TestDashboard doesn't appear)
2. The Dashboard component itself (if TestDashboard appears but Dashboard doesn't look right)

## Current Configuration

- MainInterface.js now imports and uses TestDashboard instead of Dashboard
- The TestDashboard has a very distinctive appearance that should be obvious when loading
- Routes in MainInterface.js include the TestDashboard as the index route

## Verification Steps

1. Run the application and log in
2. Check if you see the distinctive TestDashboard with red-to-green gradient
3. If you see TestDashboard:
   - Component loading is working correctly
   - Focus on fixing Dashboard.jsx
4. If you don't see TestDashboard:
   - There's an issue with routing or component loading
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify imports and routes in MainInterface.js

## Next Steps

### If TestDashboard Appears:
1. Revert MainInterface.js to use Dashboard.jsx
2. Update Dashboard.jsx with correct styling and Kratos integration
3. Focus on identifying what style or component changes are needed

### If TestDashboard Doesn't Appear:
1. Check routing configuration
2. Verify import paths
3. Check for any component overrides or nested routing issues
4. Examine App.js and AppRoutes.js for potential conflicts

## Available Scripts

- restart-test-dashboard.sh: Restarts just the frontend container
- direct-frontend-rebuild.sh: Rebuilds and restarts the frontend
- check-frontend-imports.sh: Checks imports and routes in the container
- run-local-test.sh: Runs the frontend locally for testing

## Troubleshooting

- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for any errors
- Verify that you're logged in properly with Kratos
- Check that the routes in MainInterface.js are correct
