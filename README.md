## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+, macOS, or WSL2
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum (16GB recommended)
- **CPU**: 4 cores minimum
- **Disk**: 50GB free space
- **Docker**: Installed automatically if not present

### Installation (One-Line Install)

The fastest way to get started is with our bootstrap installer:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlphaBytez/STING-CE-Public/main/bootstrap.sh)"
```

This single command will:
- Detect your platform (macOS, WSL, Debian/Ubuntu)
- Clone the repository
- Launch the web-based setup wizard

### Installation (Manual)

Prefer to clone manually? No problem:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AlphaBytez/STING-CE-Public.git
cd STING-CE-Public

# Run the installer (includes web wizard)
./install_sting.sh
```

**The installer will:**
1. ✅ Check system requirements
2. ✅ Install Docker (if needed)
3. ✅ Launch the web setup wizard at `http://localhost:8335`
4. ✅ Guide you through configuration (domain, email, LLM settings)
5. ✅ Install and start all services
6. ✅ Validate email delivery
7. ✅ Create your admin account

**After installation:**
- **Frontend**: https://localhost:8443
- **API**: https://localhost:5050
- **Mailpit** (dev mode): http://localhost:8025

### Upgrading/Reinstalling

If you already have STING-CE installed and want to upgrade or reinstall:

```bash
cd STING-CE-Public

# Reinstall (preserves your data and configuration)
./manage_sting.sh reinstall

# Fresh install (removes everything - use with caution!)
./manage_sting.sh reinstall --fresh
```

**Note:** Running `./install_sting.sh` on an existing installation will detect this and direct you to use the reinstall command instead.

### Installation (Command Line)

For headless servers or automated deployments:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AlphaBytez/STING-CE-Public.git
cd STING-CE-Public

# Create configuration from template
cp STING/conf/config.yml.default STING/conf/config.yml

# Edit configuration (set domain, email settings, etc.)
nano STING/conf/config.yml

# Run installer in non-interactive mode
./install_sting.sh --non-interactive

# Start services
./manage_sting.sh start
```

## 📖 Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `STING/docs/` directory:

## 🛠️ Management

### Service Management

```bash
# Start all services
./manage_sting.sh start

# Stop all services
./manage_sting.sh stop

# Restart a specific service
./manage_sting.sh restart [service]

# View logs
./manage_sting.sh logs [service]

# Check service status
./manage_sting.sh status
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

STING-CE uses a microservices architecture:

- **Frontend**: React-based UI with Vite
- **API**: Flask REST API with PII protection
- **Kratos**: Ory Kratos for authentication flows
- **Vault**: HashiCorp Vault for secrets
- **Bee**: AI assistant chatbot (B. Sting)
- **Knowledge**: ChromaDB vector database for Honey Jars
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for application data
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage
- **Mailpit**: Development email catcher

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Email Delivery Not Working**
```bash
python3 STING/scripts/health/validate_mailpit.py
```

**Docker Permission Denied**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Logout and login again
```

**Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Find what's using the port
sudo lsof -i :8443

# Change port in config.yml or kill the process
```

**Services Not Starting**
```bash
# Check logs
./manage_sting.sh logs

# Check system resources
free -h
df -h

# Restart with cleanup
./manage_sting.sh restart
```
