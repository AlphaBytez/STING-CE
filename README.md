This developer preview focuses on the core platform components that provide real value to developers building AI applications with security and privacy in mind.

## Core Features

- üîí **Fully Passwordless Authentication** with WebAuthn/FIDO2 passkeys and magic links
- ü§ñ **Advanced AI Integration** with Ollama support, Microsoft Phi-3, DeepSeek R1, and Apple Silicon optimization
- üß† **Knowledge Management** with vector search, semantic retrieval, and Honey Jar document stores
- üçØ **Honey Reserve** - Encrypted storage system with 1GB quota per user and lifecycle management
- üîë **Nectar Bots** - AI-as-a-Service with API key management and usage analytics
- üõ°Ô∏è **PII Compliance** with HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA pattern detection and content filtering
- üìä **Beeacon Observability** - Complete monitoring with Grafana, Loki, and Promtail

## Architecture

### Services
- **Frontend** (React 18 + Material-UI + Tailwind) - Modern responsive interface
- **Backend API** (Flask/Python) - Core business logic and API orchestration
- **Authentication** (Ory Kratos) - Passwordless identity and session management
- **Knowledge Service** (Python + Chroma) - Vector search and document processing
- **Chatbot Service** (Python) - "Bee" AI assistant with context awareness
- **External AI Service** (Python) - Ollama integration and model management
- **Public Bee Service** (Python) - Nectar Bots AI-as-a-Service API
- **Messaging Service** (Python) - Encrypted messaging with Redis queuing

### Infrastructure & Data
- **PostgreSQL** - Three separated databases (kratos, sting_app, sting_messaging)
- **Redis** - Session management and caching
- **Chroma Vector Database** - Semantic search and embeddings
- **HashiCorp Vault** - Secrets and encryption key management
- **Observability Stack** - Grafana, Loki, Promtail for monitoring and logging
